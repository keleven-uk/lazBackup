Build 2

The display now consists of three list boxes, one for the source directory,
one for the destination director and the middle one for the differences.

Added logic to walk the source and destination directories, after both have
been specified.

Added the Analyse function which determined what files have been added to the
source and not in destination, have been deleted from the destination i.e. no
longer in source.
